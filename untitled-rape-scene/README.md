*Untitled (Rape Scene)* by Ana Mendieta is a performance that occurred in the artist's apartment in Iowa city while a student at the University of Iowa in the US. The performance consisted of Mendieta, having invited fellow students to her apartment, being found bent over a table, motionless and with blood smeared across her naked thighs. Its intention was to recreate the scene, as described in the press, of a highly publicised rape and murder of nursing student Sara Ann Otten by another student earlier in 1973. The artist did not move for approximately an hour while fellow students, her audience, discussed the scene and the shock of discovering it.

Some time later the artist explained that she had created the performance "as a reaction against the idea of violence against women" (Viso, 2008, p.256) as a result of how the rape had "moved and frightened" (Manchester, 2009) her.
