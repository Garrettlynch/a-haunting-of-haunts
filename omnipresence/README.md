*Omniprésence* by the artist Orlan was the seventh medical performance of a series of plastic surgery operations titled *The Reincarnation of Saint Orlan*. The series was intended to alter the artist's appearance to reflect the ideals of Western art and cultural pressures of beauty. The surgeries included forehead implants to resemble Leonardo Da Vinci’s Mona Lisa’s prominent brow, a prosthetic chin after Sandro Botticelli’s Venus, retouches to the eyelids to suggest a School of Fontainbleau Diana and plumped lips to imitate Gustave Moreau’s Europa. The performances through surgery became a public spectacle and the artist's body, in particular her face as the site of perceived beauty, an art canvas. Its intention was to raise questions around cosmetic surgery and social taboos, unattainable beauty standards and the gruesome reality of aesthetic surgery.

Performed in an operating theatre that is typically a sterile and isolated environment, the performance was titled *Omniprésence* because the surgery:

> "was sent by satellite to galleries around the world. Orlan has become omnipresent; she is everywhere, not to be ignored or forgotten. She is tended to by doctors and nurses and we, her audience, look on anxiously while she endures the knife." (Knafo, 2009)
