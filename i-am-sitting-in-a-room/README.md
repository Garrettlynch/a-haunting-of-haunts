*I Am Sitting In A Room* by Alvin Lucier is a performance recital by Lucier that occurs in a room and is repeatedly recorded to electromagnetic tape, played back and recorded again and again until the sound has been abstracted to the point of erasing the voice of the performer. In it's original version, which was performed and recorded as an album in 1969, the performance lasts 15 minutes and 23 seconds (Hasse, 2012). In the performance Lucier recites the following text:

> "I am sitting in a room different from the one you are in now. I am recording the sound of my speaking voice and I am going to play it back into the room again and again until the resonant frequencies of the room reinforce themselves so that any semblance of my speech, with perhaps the exception of rhythm, is destroyed. What you will hear, then, are the natural resonant frequencies of the room articulated by speech. I regard this activity not so much as a demonstration of a physical fact, but more as a way to smooth out any irregularities my speech might have." (Wikipedia, 2020)

While the performance consists only of sound Lucier's wife, pioneer artist Mary Lucier, created a series of Polaroid photographs of the Lucier's living room in Middletown, Connecticut in the US that employ a similar process to accompany it. The first of these images was used as the cover of the 1969 album of the performance and in 1970, transfered to slides, the series was used alongside the sound performance in its premier at the Guggenheim Museum (Klein, 2019). It is unclear if the room featured in Mary Lucier's Polaroid series is the same room Alvin was sat in and originally recorded the performance from, however, it is suggested as such in this media kit.
