## Walking in an Exaggerated Manner around a Square (1967)
### Bruce Nauman, US

*Walking in an Exaggerated Manner around a Square* by Bruce Nauman is one of a series of performances that occurred in the artist's studios between 1967 and 1969. These were initially documented as photos and later examples, such as this performance, were documented in videos. In the video performances the artist can be seen to perform a number of repetitive, choreographed and often mundane actions including stamping, jumping, playing the violin and bouncing balls. Most frequently, however, the artist employs walking. In some performances Nauman explores the rhythms of walking or, such as in *Dance or Exercise on the Perimeter of a Square*, stamping out a set of changing tempos. In *Walking in an Exaggerated Manner around a Square* the artist can be seen performing in his studio in Southampton, New York:

> "he explores gait, shifting his weight from leg to leg in an exaggerated manner...his walking is enclosed within the confines of taped lines, a corridor, or the studio itself. When exhibited, these works are played on a loop, making it easy to imagine that Nauman has been pacing forever."
