### About

*A Haunting of Haunts* is a collection of media packs that allow artists to reenact or create new networked performance art based on landmark performance art. It provides media in image and 3D formats that can be employed within a number of networked environments.


### Usage

Each pack contains a high resolution image of the scene of a performance, a Collada 3D file and the source scene Blender file.

*	The images can be used as video backgrounds in video conferencing applications such as [Zoom](https://zoom.us/) or through video streaming/mixing applications such as [CamTwist](http://camtwiststudio.com/) and [OBS](https://obsproject.com/).
*	The Collada 3D files can be imported to [Second Life](https://secondlife.com/), [Unity](https://unity.com/) or any other 3D application that enables models to be imported.
*	The source Blender files can be improved, reworked, added to or remixed in any way and exported as image, video or 3D.

Artist's are encouraged to freely employ provided media within reenactments of landmark performance art or as source media for their own performances. 


### Contributing

There are a number of ways to contribute to *A Haunting of Haunts*:

1. The reenactment or creation of performances with media provided.
	* Performances can be created through the use of the provided performance image or Collada 3D file. To have documentation of the performance included as part of this repository contact Garrett Lynch IRL through GitHub.

2. The reworking of current performance media.
	* Media provided as part of performances listed in this repository can be improved, reworked, added to or remixed in any way and included in branch repositorys from the master branch. To request inclusion in the master branch please file a merge request.

3. The creation of new performance media.
	* New performance media i.e. of performances not currently included in this repository, can be created and included in branch repositorys from the master branch. To request inclusion in the master branch please file a merge request.


### Statement

During the lockdowns of the Covid 19 pandemic in 2020 networked technologies that were not particularly new or innovative were rediscovered as a means to communicate during social distancing. Video conferencing in particular quickly become the standard adopted means of work, education and collaboration. In a sense old became new again, was presented as if it never was, quickly integrated as part of essential communication infrastructures and its use became a key skill.

Networked performance practices have for many years been defined by these networked technologies and their form. Consequently, the pandemic brought to the fore several questions about this type of artistic practice. If the use of networked technologies is now a key everyday skill employed widely, can networked performance truly align itself with technology art, as it often has been (Zapp 2004; Dixon 2007), or does it revert to a closer relationship with performance art of the 20th century? If the latter is the case, and for many it is highly contentious that it qualifies as having any relationship with those art forms (Phelan 1993; Salter 2010; McHugh 2011), has networked performance become isolated within art history? Is it pushed to irrelevance by the current popularisation and commonisation of its technological forms, doomed to be haunted by its artistic predecessors?

In response to these questions and reflecting on the condition of performance in confinement I started to model a series of scenes in 3D during lockdown that recreate the locations of landmark performance art without the presence of the artist who performed them. All performances selected occurred in the interior spaces of an artistâ€™s home, studio or residency to parallel the confined circumstances artists were now required to create within, during lockdown. The result is a series of media packs for performance that consist of 3D rendered images and models created from video and photography documentation as reference of the original performances. The media can be employed within various networked environments such as through [Zoom's](https://zoom.us/) virtual backgrounds or imported models in [Second Life](https://secondlife.com/). Employing the media packs artists can reenact performances or create new works inspired by them within the context of digital technology and networked performance.

The series is intended to facilitate the exploration of what can be achieved when spatial and corporeal possibilites are on the one hand limited or simplified but when the necessity of technology to view performance is on the other a way to move beyond those limitations. This is most obviously demonstrated in how artists can appear out of their actual living or studio spaces and in another. The spaces/props and the bodies/actions of the performances, however, are only 'virtually' co-present: technically in image, through bluescreening, 3D rendering, interpretation etc. and conceptually through the concept of hautology. While network technologies employed remove the limitations of the space occupied artists have to refer to what they know, for example landmark performances, or what their current frame of reference lets them imagine, perhaps a performance in a space they know. This existing awareness of performances, spaces known to the artist and so forth then in a sense haunts all new performances, a condition that spans all creative practices in post-modernism and beyond.
