### Statement

During the Covid 19 pandemic and numerous countries’ strategy of lockdowns and social distancing networked technologies that were not particularly new or cutting-edge have been rediscovered. Video conferencing in particular has quickly become the standard adopted means of work, education, and collaboration. In a sense old has become new (again), presented as if it has never was, quickly integrated as part of essential communication infrastructures and it’s use a key skill.

Networked performance practices have for many years been defined by the form of networked technologies. Consequently, the pandemic has brought to the fore several questions about this type of artistic practice and its use of these technologies. If the use of networked technologies is now a key everyday skill employed widely, can networked performance truly align itself with technology art, as it often has (Zapp 2004; Dixon 2007), or does it revert to a closer relationship with performance and video art of the 20th century? If the latter is the case, and for many it is still highly contentious that it qualifies as having any relationship with those art forms (Phelan 1993; Salter 2010; McHugh 2011), has networked performance become isolated within art history, pushed to irrelevance by current popularisation and commonisation of its technological form, doomed to be haunted by its artistic predecessors?

In response to these questions I started to model a series of scenes during lockdown that recreate the locations of 20th century performance and video art without the presence of the artist who performed them. The scenes consist of 3D rendered images and models recreated from video and photography documentation of the performances that can be used within various networked technologies e.g. as virtual backgrounds in Zoom or imported models in Second Life. Performances can as such be created anew yet reworked within the context of networked performance. In line with the confined circumstances networked artists are presently required to create within, all scenes are interiors, either of the artist’s home or studio. The scenes will all be released in the public domain as a form of kit intended to provoke thinking around the hauntological problems of the form of networked performance through the use of location. At present four scenes have been created based on the performances Scratching Both Walls at Once by Rebecca Horn (Figure 1), Untitled (Rape Scene) by Ana Mendieta (Figure 2), I Like America and America Likes Me by Joseph Beuys (Figure 3) and Walking in an Exaggerated Manner around a Square by Bruce Nauman (Figure 4). More will be added before the kit will be released.
