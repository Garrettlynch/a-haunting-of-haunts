*Six Colorful Inside Jobs* by John Baldessari is a performance in which the artist instructs a student to paint the walls and floor of a small room a different colour each day for six days. The performance is filmed from the ceiling of the room through a top-down view and then sped-up for the performance's documentation so that each day's painting takes approximately five minutes.

The performance addresses numerous ideas in relation to painting, cinema, art as process,  and the role of the artist. These include: contrasting different types of painting employed in different contexts, such as painting by an artist and painting by a house decorator; the two-dimensionality of colour field painting that fills the shot and the three-dimensionality of the room being painted; the medium of paint as a liquid substance and the medium of light in cinema; art as an extended performative process that can be compressed; art/painting by proxy and instruction. Baldessari touches on many of these ideas when he recalls a memory from his youth as the basis of the performance:

> "My father was a landlord and I kept his rentals up painting them, and I used to occupy my mind as I was painting the wall just by saying to myself, now I'm painting a wall, now I'm making a painting. And it would just be a conceptual exercise. The physical activity was the same, I was just calling it differently each time. So I began to think about, well, what separated one from the other? Why was one different?" (MoMA, 2020)
