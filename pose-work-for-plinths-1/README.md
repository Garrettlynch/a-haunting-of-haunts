*Pose Work for Plinths I* by Bruce McLean is a performance conceived for the Situation Gallery, London in 1971. It was the first of three performances that explored the concepts of sculpture, action, the body and the role of plinths in gallery settings. As such it was firmly embedded in conceptual art's discourse surrounding the object. McLean recalls in an interview in 2016:

> "I was an action sculptor at the time, making 'impersonations' of sculptures. My throwaway pieces existed in the street and weren’t made for a gallery. As a conceptual artist, I wanted to get rid of the object. Some people would call what I did 'performance art', but I don’t like the term. I’m a sculptor who makes live work, and I was trying to develop the nature of what sculpture could be." (Andreasson, 2016)
