# I Like America and America Likes Me (1974)
### Joseph Beuys, Germany

The performance I Like America And America Likes Me by Joseph Beuys occurred at the René Block Gallery in New York from the 23rd to 25th of May 1974. It consisted of the artist being locked in a room in the gallery for the three days with a live coyote.

The performance's title is employed with irony. Beuys had a troubled relationship with American politics and in particular the Vietname War. He refused to set foot on American soil while the war was occuring so



As Beuys later explained: ‘I wanted to isolate myself, insulate myself, see nothing of America other than the coyote.’ The title of the work is filled with irony. Beuys opposed American military actions in Vietnam, and his work as an artist was a challenge to the hegemony of American art.

Beuys’s felt blankets, walking stick and gloves became sculptural props throughout the Action. In addition, fifty new copies of the Wall Street Journal were introduced each day, which the coyote acknowledged by urinating on them. Beuys regularly performed the same series of actions with his eyes continuously fixed on the coyote. At other times he would rest or gather the felt around him to suggest the figure of a shepherd with his crook. The coyote’s behaviour shifted throughout the three days, becoming cautious, detached, aggressive and sometimes companionable. At the end of the Action, Beuys was again wrapped in felt and returned to the airport.
