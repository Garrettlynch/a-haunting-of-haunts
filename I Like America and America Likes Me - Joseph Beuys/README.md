## I Like America and America Likes Me (1974)
### Joseph Beuys, Germany

The performance I Like America And America Likes Me by Joseph Beuys occurred at the René Block Gallery in New York from the 23rd to 25th of May 1974. The performance's title is employed with irony reflecting Beuys troubled relationship with US politics and in particular its involvement in the Vietnam War. This relationship shaped the performance, which consisted of Beuys flying to New York blindfolded, being wrapped in felt and carried to an ambulance which took him directly to the gallery. For the three days spent at the gallery the artist was locked in a room with a live coyote. On completion of the performance he was returned to the airport in the same manner and departed the US.



 without having set foot on US soil or moving beyond the room of the performance. Beuys later explained: "I wanted to isolate myself, insulate myself, see nothing of America other than the coyote." (Tate, 2005)

The coyote is both a sacred animal for certain American Indian populations but equally has a status as vermin in Western cultures. As such, for Beuys, the performance was a reconcilation with this animal intended to represent the encounter between modern humanity and a lost spirituality.







Beuys invited the United States to confront the massacre of the native peoples of North America. Joseph Beuys, who had refused to set foot on American soil during the Vietnam War, seemed to be applying an approach to the United States that he had until then conducted in Germany: attempting to heal a people by causing them to face up to the darkest chapters of their history.
 




The title of the work is filled with irony. Beuys opposed American military actions in Vietnam, and his work as an artist was a challenge to the hegemony of American art.

Beuys’s felt blankets, walking stick and gloves became sculptural props throughout the Action. In addition, fifty new copies of the Wall Street Journal were introduced each day, which the coyote acknowledged by urinating on them. Beuys regularly performed the same series of actions with his eyes continuously fixed on the coyote. At other times he would rest or gather the felt around him to suggest the figure of a shepherd with his crook. The coyote’s behaviour shifted throughout the three days, becoming cautious, detached, aggressive and sometimes companionable. At the end of the Action, Beuys was again wrapped in felt and returned to the airport.
