The performance I Like America And America Likes Me by Joseph Beuys occurred at the RenÃ© Block Gallery in New York from the 23rd to 25th of May 1974. The performance's title is employed with irony reflecting Beuys troubled relationship with the United States' politics and in particular its involvement in the Vietnam War. This relationship shaped the performance, which consisted of Beuys flying to New York blindfolded, being wrapped in felt and carried to an ambulance which took him directly to the gallery. For the three days spent at the gallery the artist was locked in a room with a live coyote. On completion of the performance he was returned to the airport in the same manner and departed the US without having set foot on US soil or moving beyond the room of the performance. Beuys later explained: 

> "I wanted to isolate myself, insulate myself, see nothing of America other than the coyote." (Tate, 2005)

The coyote is both a sacred animal for certain American Indian populations but equally has a status as vermin in Western cultures. As such, for Beuys, the performance was a reconcilation with this animal intended to represent the encounter between modern humanity and a lost spirituality. Beuys invited the US to confront the massacre of the native peoples of North America whilst in the midst of another bloody conflict. In doing so he applied an approach to the US that he had until then only conducted in Germany: attempting to heal a nation by causing them to face up to the darkest chapters of their history.
