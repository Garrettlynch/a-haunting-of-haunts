The avatar is an extension of the artist in the virtual world, it’s what lets the artist be in contact with the virtual environment. A non-body moving in a non-place. We can say that for the avatar the artist represents its 'physical extension' in the real world. But can the avatar have consciousness of itself and of its extension? What is connected to it? 'Have you ever been a human being?' is the question addressed to itself, the artist and the audience.

As a result of the pandemic, networked performance practices have become a critical part of my creative and teaching practices. I believe that performance art needs to align with technology art, or else risk becoming a relic of video art in the 20th century. During quarantine I have had the privilege of watching and learning TikTok dances with my stepdaughter and wanted to combine *Walking in an Exaggerated Manner around the Perimeter of a Square* (Bruce Nauman, 1967) with a *Blinding Lights* (The Weekend, 2019) dance tutorial. Nauman’s work has long had a hauntological impact on my studio practice and informed my transition from painting to interdisciplinary practices in 2006.

Given the restrictions of the ongoing lockdown, I filmed this video in my apartment, moving my bed and hanging sheets on the wall as a DIY green screen. I found the gesture of walking around the perimeter of a square an important metaphor for the meditative mundanity of quarantine. While making work in a confined space is frustrating and imperfect, it is also reassuring that no matter what happens, whatever the restriction, the work can go on and the power of creativity is not limited to space, or corporeal ability.
